I get <em>a lot</em> of email at work.

I'm on eleven team distribution lists, I run our UI community of practice, I get a slew of automated garbage, and that doesn't include emails actually <em>sent to me</em>.

Back in March, I received one email that read, in part:
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hi Bill
</span>I wanted to get in touch and gauge your interest in speaking at the Data Visualization Summit – Boston, MA - September 25 &amp; 26, 2014.
The event brings together data viz leaders, analysts &amp; scientists working in various industries to discuss how high dimensional data, visual analytics &amp; computational aesthetics for data are offering new ways for companies to better understand how to use their data &amp; make it more efficient.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>[...]</em></p>
<p class="p1">Please let me know if you are available to participate, or if you have any questions regarding the event and I can give you a call to discus this further.
I look forward to talking with you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Reading back on it now, it seems totally innocuous.  But for whatever reason, at the time, all I could think was that this was some elaborate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/419_scams" target="_blank">419</a> scam, and that I was a few responses away from being introduced to Nigerian royalty.  Either that, or someone had found a whole slew of Orbitz UIEs on LinkedIn, and spammed the pile.</p>
<p class="p1">But I asked around, and nobody else at the company had received the same email. The suspicion mounted.</p>
<p class="p1">A few days passed, and I decided to respond to the email, but being a master sleuth, I asked the sender to set up a time to call me.</p>

<h2 class="p1">He did.</h2>
<p class="p1">A week later, I was sitting in a conference room, dialing a real phone number that connected to a real phone with this real person at the other end.  As it had turned out, the company reaching out puts on a whole slew of conferences, and at a previous one, had given out a questionnaire asking: "Who would you like to see speak at a future conference?" to which someone had responded: "Someone from Orbitz."</p>
<p class="p1">"Someone from Orbitz," for reasons I still don't quite understand, filtered down to Bill "Hi, I'm someone from Orbitz" Hinderman.</p>
<p class="p1">Here's the one problem.  Apart from <a href="http://thecocktailgui.de" target="_blank">The Cocktail Gui.de</a>, I don't really know a ton about Data Visualization.  My mind immediately went to the work I am starting with our Site Optimization group to distill huge portions of our web traffic for A:B testing.</p>
<p class="p1">For a while, I noodled on that idea, and kept feeling like I was taking the easy route.</p>

<h2 class="p1">I didn't want to fly to Boston to just talk about my job.  I wanted to be a voice for change.</h2>
<p class="p1">I grabbed two sheets of printer paper and labeled them as:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="p1">Data Visualization</li>
	<li class="p1">Things I Care About</li>
</ul>

<hr />

&nbsp;

On the former, I began writing down all the topics I could think of, related to the data visualization space.  On the latter, I spewed out all the topics in web design that I had a passion for.  Once I was finished, I began making phrases by picking one idea from each page.

My goals here were the following:
<ul>
	<li>Talk about something I care about</li>
	<li>Talk about something people haven't talked about</li>
	<li>Talk about something I don't know enough about</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p class="p1">After a hilariously short amount of time, I had found something that hit all three points:</p>

<h2 class="p1">Responsive Data Visualization</h2>
In essence: how can responsive web design inform data visualization as we move to a multi-device internet?  RWD has change the way we think of our content's containers, but we're still skipping the problem of cramming too much data into a container that just doesn't scale.

So that's where we are.  I care about it.  Virtually nothing has been written on the subject.  And (because of the last sentence), I'm learning as I create.

See you in September, Boston.
